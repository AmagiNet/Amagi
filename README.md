What is "Amagi Project" ?
-------------------------------

Code was first..
    
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <amagi>

        <creator>human</creator>
    </amagi>

The Amagi Project, created with the aim of spreading the values of free hardware and software,
as well as its use to create free networks.

Amagi equation 

[[ Free Hardware + Free OS ] + Free Software Apps ] + [ Free Networks ] + [ Open Data ] = Free World


    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <equation>
        <components>
            <first>Free Hardware</first>
            <second>Free OS</second>
            <third>Free Software Apps</third>
            <fourth>Free Networks</fourth>
            <fifth>Open Data</fifth>
            <total>Free World</total>
        </components>
    </equation>

Therefore, the project is designed to implement this formula in our real world.

The ways to apply the formula are infinite. The Amagi project is dedicated to travel and study these ways
to get a better and happy world for everyone, without exception.

Wake up and join the Amagi movement !


What is "Amagi Network Project" ?
-------------------------------


Project on building a global free mesh network AMAGI - class I

AMAGI class I : All the devices connected

    - are free hardware running
    - have a free operative system running
    - have free software apps running
    - are connected to a free network
    - send opendata to an Amagi Server (AMAGI Data Protocol)


Devices List :

    - Embebbed Systems ( Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard, Arduino.. )
    - Phones
    - Tablets
    - Set Top Boxes
    - Stations ( sensors )
    - Others

These are the initial requirements

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <device>
        <requirements>
            <freehardware>      </freehardware>
            <freeos>            </freeos>
            <freesoft>          </freesoft>
            <freenet>           </freenet>
            <opendata>          </opendata>
